## Day 1 – Learnings from WSL Installation

Today I learned the importance of setting up the correct development environment before starting practical work.

I understood that WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) allows running a Linux environment inside Windows without using a virtual machine. This makes development more efficient and lightweight.

I realized that many development and data science tools work better in a Linux-based environment. Installing Ubuntu 24.04 inside WSL helped me understand how real-world systems are configured.

I also practiced basic Linux commands and understood how package management works using apt.

Overall, this session helped me understand that environment setup is the foundation for further learning.
